# David Bradshaw Database Final Project

This is the final project for Database Design and Development class for Fall 2020 at Pratt Institute.

## Getting started

Run `npm install` then `cd client && npm install && cd ..`

## Running the server and client

Run `npm run start`.  This will run both at the same time.  

## SQL Commands

All SQL happens via the sql Class in the server.  By default expects to use school_user@localhost using password school_pass.  Which should have acccess to the database.  Which can be created via the `create.sql` file in the sql directory.
